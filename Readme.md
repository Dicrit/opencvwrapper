# Opencvwrapper
Hello. This is my framework which wraps opencv functionality. Only for demonstration purposes.
It's a complete Android Studio project.

### Framework
opencvwrapperlib is an adndroid library that includes shared libraries for the framework (potentially can be changed into static), headers and a ready-to-use kotlin file.

#### build opencv
It requires opencv build using the build_opencv.sh script. Also it can be built using any method, just then you need to recreate the directories structure.

#### Absolute paths
In the code there are some absolute paths. It's better to replace them with veriables, but it's just a optional improvement. I'll do it if needed. Again, this project is just a demonstration.

### Demo app
Demo app sources are located inside app directory.
